# todo-list App

The Odin Project: ToDo List Assignment

Live Preview: https://jomersdev.github.io/todo-list/

This project combined everything that has been taught in the previous lessons: OOP, webpack, code organisation

It introduced the concept of localStorage was allows this ToDo List app to be persistent between browser refreshes and sessions. 

Future features: 

Projects tab on the left side of page to allow grouping and filtering of different task groups ie (school, coding, gym etc.)

Overhaul the style of the entire page, currently it uses the exact same styling as the Library project form earlier
